# miscellaneous
People tell me that there is other things beyond coding and calculus. That is something I try not to forget by enjoying other hobbies.

##### Music
I used to produce music for fun and DJ in some places. I still have an equipment and enjoy using it whenever I have
time. 

Dancing at 120 BPM is one of things I enjoy the most.<br/>

Playing the ukulele is another way I have found of expressing myself.

##### Food
I love cooking. Rices, home made pasta and fresh veggetables are probably my favourites.

I started the **Pan Ribas** project with my brother, an initiative to share visuals on our shared passion: baking bread.

##### Technology
From time to time, I enjoy doing "smart-home" mini projects with my Raspberries and unix devices. You can find some
