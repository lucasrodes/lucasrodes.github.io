## he/him

I'm a software developer and data scientist focused on open-source projects that bring data closer to people. I'm interested in open sciences, open data, environmental sciences, health, and more.

You can find me at [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org), primarily working on COVID-19.

[Ping me](./pages/contact) for collaborations — or to say hi.
